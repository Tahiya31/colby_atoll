# Colby Atoll Project 🏝️

Climate change poses significanrt threats to the stability and sustainability of atoll ecosystems worldwide. To effectively monitor and quantify the impacts of climate change on atoll morphometrics, this study employs an unique approach using smenatic segmentation, a deep learning based image analysis technique. High-resolution satellite imagery is processed and classified into distinct features of reef, island, and ocean components
