# Colby Atoll Project üèùÔ∏è

Climate change poses significanrt threats to the stability and sustainability of atoll ecosystems worldwide. To effectively monitor and quantify the impacts of climate change on atoll morphometrics, this study employs an unique approach using smenatic segmentation, a deep learning based image analysis technique. High-resolution satellite imagery is processed and classified into distinct features of reef, island, and ocean components

## Running the models:

The different models built in this project are all present in the `Models` folder with each model being trained on a different image type. The Dataset for the project is all zipped up inside `Dataset.zip`. To actually run the models on some images or train your own model, refer to the notebooks below: 

* To run the models, go to this [notebook](https://github.com/Tahiya31/colby_atoll/blob/main/Notebooks/Model%20Prediction.ipynb)

* To train the models, go to this [notebook](https://github.com/Tahiya31/colby_atoll/blob/main/Notebooks/Model%20Training.ipynb)
